## About
Personal Calendar is an application which holds an accurate calendar where one can add events to a date and view that event. The application provides the feature to navigate through the dates from 1970 to 2099. One can navigate throught months using the arrow button in the calendar header or can use the drop down to just jump to a spific month or year. It also has a button to jump to current month by using the `Today` button. It also provides the feature to search the event and jump to that specific month of the event.__
For adding an event click on the date and then a modal will open which will ask for the name, description, date, time and duration of the event. To view and event click on the event name, a modal will open where the details of the event will be displayed. When there is more than 3 events on a particular date, `more` button appears on clicking which a modal opens listing the events on that day. On can also view the details of the particular event in that list by just clicking on it. The code for the application is in my github profile, following is the link for that,
